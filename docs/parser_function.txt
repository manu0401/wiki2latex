/*
Parserfunctions are processed prior to any latex-conversion, so all original function
should be usable as long as they don't call the parser-object itself, as W2L looks
a bit different on the inside, than what a function designed for the original parser
could imagine.

Look at the mediawiki manual to see, how parserfunctions are registered to Mediawiki.
If they are, you need to register them to W2L by this line (or have a look at w2lConfig.php):
$w2lParserFunctions['myParserFunction']    = 'myParserFunction';

Please have a look at existing parserfunctions to learn, how to create your own.
