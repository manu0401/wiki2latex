<!--
Every W2L-Template must be in the Namespace "LaTeX" and must begin with "W2L_"!

the latexfile tag defines a tex-file. This one here is going to be created as Main.tex,
which is a file, every template needs, because pdflatex is called with Main.tex.

If you add another one, you could give it any name, and the file is created, and can be
used via \input or \include with the appropriate name.

You can even load files, which are not dependend on your templates. For this to work, 
you need to follow these steps:
1. Create a page in your LaTeX-namespace (like: LaTeX:Foobar)
2. Before the first latexfile-command in your template insert this:
<latexpage>LaTeX:Foobar</latexpage>
3. Open the latex-page and fill put your latex-source into one latex-tag. Everything
outside will be ignored.
4. Your W2L-Latex-Template can \input or \include it via \input{Foobar}
